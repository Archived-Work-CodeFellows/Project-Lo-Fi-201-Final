# Lo-fi Generator - MVP Stories and Basic Layout
(I was wrong, it is Low-Fidelity but the overall sound is with cut high frequencies)

# Problem Domain:

To create a website that present the user with a simple two button selection. One button will have the selection of Harmony and the second button
will have the selection of Chaos. After the user makes a selection, javascript is then directed to the appropriate directory to begin play the audio
files in that directory.

JavaScript needs to then be able to effectively manipulate the DOM and html5 audio player to play, loop and fade in between different files as to not
disrupt the user with anything that is jarring to remove the immersion of the playlist

Use pre-fabricated samples to create the basic functionality and algorithms with the idea of scaling the project in the future

# As per the final project requirements(Layout/Appearance):

### Public Facing Page - 
* Two buttons, when selected the appropriate folder of sounds is selected and played
* Option between simple CSS visulizer or no visuals (default to CSS visulizer)
* Local storage to remember users selection to play the selected folder

### About Me Page -
* Three pictures with bios

### Third Page
* Need to figure out what a third page could look like (Mock-up a user profile?)
***

# MVP Stories:

* As the user, I want to use a site that has a simple UI that immediately reacts to my selection
* As the user, I want the transition between sounds to be seamless and not take me out of my immersion
* As the user, I want the site to retain my selection even if I leave that it will remember my selection and ask if I want to continue with that selection
* As the developer, I want to create methods that appropriately maniuplate the audio player (fade, volume, looping) to achieve immersion
* As the developer, I want the CSS to be a simple experience but also reflect the selection of the user
* As the developer, I want datasets that are relative to each other so that the audio flies that are played, mix together
* As the developer, I want the files to be loaded and ready without the users knowledge
